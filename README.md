This course will walk you through how to use JavaScript objects and create and use JSON as a JavaScript object. Explore how JSON works and how to access data contained within JSON output. This course shows you how to work with JSON-formatted data, output content, loop JSON data, parse JSON, and a whole lot more. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a data syntax. JSON is easier to use than XML and human-readable. Most modern web APIs output data in the JSON format. This course covers working within JavaScript code to produce dynamic functionality. You will learn what JavaScript objects are and how to create them, how JavaScript objects can use arrays to hold multiple items, and more.
